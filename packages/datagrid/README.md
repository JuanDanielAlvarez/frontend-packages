# @tailor-platform/datagrid

This package provides a Datagrid component and hooks tailored for managing complex data tables.

## Architecture

The `@tailor-platform/datagrid` combines the headless Tanstack Table with the `@tailor-platform/design-systems` for reusable UI components.

## Tech Stacks

### Tanstack Table

The foundation of our Datagrid is the Tanstack Table library. Learn more about it [here](https://tanstack.com/table/v8).

### Tailor Design Systems

We leverage `@tailor-platform/design-systems` for consistent UI components. Here are few component examples that are used in datagrid:
